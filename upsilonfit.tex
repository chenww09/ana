\section{Determination of $\Upsilon$ yields}
\label{sec:UpsilonFit}

The yields of \OneS, \TwoS and \ThreeS particles are determined by fitting the dimuon invariant mass distribution. The combinatorial background is described by... The $\Upsilon$ peaks 
are parameterized with... The $\alpha$ and $n$ parameters of the Crystal Ball function are fixed to... etc... the floating parameters in the fit are... 
Figure XX and YY show the invariant mass distribution in 2011 and 2012 data, respectively. The event yields and other fit parameters are reported in Table ZZ. 
The systematic uncertainties in the $\Upsilon$ yields are determined by... They are discussed in \ref{sec:systematics}.
