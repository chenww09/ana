\section{Determination of the $\chi_b$ yields}
\label{sec:ChibFit}

The yields of $\chi_b(1S, 2S, 3S)$ \to \OneS $\gamma$ are determined with fits to the $m(\mu^+\mu^-\gamma) - m(\mu^+\mu^-)$ invariant mass difference. Combinatorial background is 
described by ..., signal are parametrized with ... Mention how you fix and float the various parameters of this fit... 
Figure XX and Table YY show the results...
