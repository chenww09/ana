\section{Data - Monte Carlo comparison}
\label{sec:dataMCcomparison}

A comparison of the distribution of the relevant observables used in this analysis was performed on real and simulated data, in order to assess the reliability of Monte Carlo in 
computing efficiencies. It should be stressed that, since a relative branching fraction is measured, systematic effects cancel at first order. 

Combinatorial background has been subtracted in real data by using an \sPlot technique, where the discriminant distribution is... The resulting signal weights are used to obtain the signal 
distribution for each relevant variable. These distributions are then compared with simulation, as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:AAA}-\ref{fig:ZZZ}. The agreement is generally very good, 
giving confidence that the Monte Carlo describes correctly the decays under study.
