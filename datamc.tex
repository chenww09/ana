\section{Data and Monte-Carlo samples}
\label{sec:dataMC}

The data sample used in this analysis has been collected by \lhcb in 2011 and 2012, at center-of-mass energies of \sqs=7\tev and 8\tev, respectively. For 2011, both Reco12
(?) and Reco14/Stripping 20 samples were used.  The former was privately stripped by Vanya (?).  

The corresponding integrated luminosities are...

Events are triggered by... 

and subsequently stripped by StrippingMicroDSTDiMuonDiMuonIncLine. This line takes StdLooseDiMuon as input, applies requirements on 
muon momentum, transverse momentum, track and vertex chisquares, and transverse momentum of the composite particle 

{\tt{(MINTREE('mu+'==ABSID,PT) > 650.0 *MeV) \& 
(MINTREE('mu+'==ABSID,P) > -8000.0 *MeV) \& 
(MAXTREE('mu+'==ABSID,TRCHI2DOF) < 5.0) \& 
(in\_range( 3000.0 *MeV, MM, 100000000.0 *MeV)) \& 
(VFASPF(VCHI2PDOF)< 20.0) \& 
(PT > 2000.0)}}

and saves the output in MicroDST format. The StdLooseDiMuon list contains pairs of oppositely charged muon from the StdAllLooseMuons list with the additional 
requirement CombinationCut  (ADOCACHI2CUT(30, '')), MotherCut   (VFASPF(VCHI2) < 25)


Simulated data were produced with 2011 conditions. Six samples of XX million events each were generated, each corresponding to a different decay under study. 
Table \ref{tab:dataMCsamples} summarizes the various samples used in this analysis.
